The main directory. Use make to build the simulation modells. 'makeneddoc.sh'
is a workaround script for OPP 3.1 for making neddoc docs. You need a working

Use 'run.sh' in the subdirectories of Simulation to run the simulations
automatically. If needed, please change the Makefile in the bin directories
for switching between TK and shell environment.
