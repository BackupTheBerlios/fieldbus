	 * "total time delay" and the "average time delay" are devided in a case where propagation

	 * \f{align*}
	 * T_{delay}^{sum}&=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N}
	 * \sum_{j=1}^{m(i)}T_{delay}^{(i,j)} \\

	 * T_{delay}^{sum}&=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{m(i)}T_{delay}^{(i,j)} \\
	 * T_{delay}^{avg}&=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\frac{1}{m(i)}
	 * \sum_{j=1}^{m(i)}T_{delay}^{(i,j)}\right)
	 * \f}
	 * Common for all equations is:
	 * \f{align*}
	 * N&={Number\ of\ nodes} \\
	 * m(i)&={Number\ of\ sent\ messages\ from\ node\ i} \\
	 * T_{delay}^{(i,j)}&=T_{queue}^{(i,j)}+T_{block}^{(i,j)}+T_{tx}^{(i,j)} \\

	 * \f}
	 * What's different:<ul>
	 * <li>\f$m(i)\f$ is a more precisely value for \f$M(i)\f$ because \f$M(i)\f$ is oriented
	 * to periodical messages, we want to have a more common case which depends on
	 * messages arriving policies. Such a policy can be a periodical arriving.
	 * <li>The first case...</ul>
	 * What's equal:<ul>
	 * <li>Needless to say the second case</ul>
